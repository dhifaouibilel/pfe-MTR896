We've been seeing warnings emitted to the python 3 unit tests:

  OsloDBDeprecationWarning: EngineFacade is deprecated; please use
  oslo_db.sqlalchemy.enginefacade

which stem from our use of the get_legacy_facade() oslo.db method.

This replaces the get_legacy_facade() usage with the get_engine()
method from the transaction context manager.

This solves the problem that bootstrap_nodeid, which is set to the
first node in each role via t-h-t, can match potentially more than
one node - e.g in the event that a service is deployed such that it
spans more than one role.

The SERVICE_short_bootstrap_node_name is automatically generated
based on the composable service template service_name, and this
considers all roles where the service is enabled, e.g it should
only evaluate true once regardles off the roles where the service
is enabled.

We're using a hardcoded 15 seconds timeout when canceling WMI jobs.

Some jobs may not be cancelable, some may take longer to stop. For
example, Nova instances may end up in error state after attempting
to delete them as this hardcoded timeout gets exceeded.

That being considered, we're now adding a config option for this,
also increasing the default timeout to 2 minutes.

Ideally, Nova should pass a timeout here. Still, by adding a config

central fails to update the zone's action/status in DB to UPDATE/PENDING.

Each operation retrieves a different copy in memory of the Zone object

The osquery tooling needed a little work to be fully automated and
repeatable. This change tunes up the tools and makes the entire
deployment process multi-node capable and repeatable.

The osquery role was vendored because of bugs within their use of aarmor
profiles and there was no way to disable them.

The fleet use of commands for ssl creation have been removed. The ssl
modules are now being used to generate all of the certificates.

New pre-tasks have been added to check for required variables. If the
required variables are not set the playbooks will fail early and notify
the user of the issue.

This works by writing the new puppet host manifest under
/var/lib/tripleo-config/check-mode, and diffing it against the existing
version of the manifest.

Puppet is also run with --noop, so that it only reports on what changes
would have been made.

It also uses the check mode hiera configuration at

data is also accounted for when puppet runs with --noop.

When two management systems are available openstack/cinder and
SolidFire-API/GUI  a volume can be deleted though either interface. Thus
if a volume is deleted through the SolidFire-interface and then again
through the openstack/cinder interface it was possible to delete another
volume.

The original code made an incorrect assumption on all the possible values returned
from a query to find the target volume. This could lead to deleting a
volume that was not the target of the original delete command from openstack/cinder.

The correction in the module _get_sfvol_by_cinder_vref  validates that the
returned object/volumes-id matchs the requested volume-id with a
comparison of svol['volumeID'] to int(sf_vid)

This reverts commit e91dad3ee93b1c0c4201e1e679a8c5b333879b5f.

The release notes said it was okay not to run the nova-consoleauth
service in Rocky, but that's not true because the Rocky code is storing
new console authorization tokens in both the database backend and the
existing nova-consoleauth backend. The use of nova-consoleauth will be
discontinued in Stein (for non-cells v1). We can't remove
nova-consoleauth until we remove cells v1.

 Conflicts:

NOTE(melwitt): The conflicts are due to the fact that the nova-ec2
service no longer exists in the api-guide and the release note had
been modified in 4f01f4ff88de571218a36ba7c4e998296a7b52a4 after being
added in e91dad3ee93b1c0c4201e1e679a8c5b333879b5f.

This reverts commit e91dad3ee93b1c0c4201e1e679a8c5b333879b5f.

The release notes said it was okay not to run the nova-consoleauth
service in Rocky, but that's not true because the Rocky code is storing
new console authorization tokens in both the database backend and the
existing nova-consoleauth backend. The use of nova-consoleauth will be
discontinued in Stein (for non-cells v1). We can't remove
nova-consoleauth until we remove cells v1.

In Rocky, we deprecated the nova-consoleauth service but there were
unconditional calls to nova-consoleauth in the compute/api, which
made it impossible to avoid running the nova-consoleauth service.

This adds conditional checks to call nova-consoleauth only if the
[workarounds]enable_consoleauth configuration option is True. The
option defaults to False because the default console token auth TTL
is 10 minutes and only operators who have configured much longer TTL
or otherwise wish to avoid resetting all consoles at upgrade time
need to use the option.

This also updates the /os-console-auth-tokens/{console_token} API to
use nova-consoleauth only if the [workarounds] option is enabled. This
had to be done in the same change because the conditional checks in
the compute/api code caused the /os-console-auth-tokens API functional
tests to fail to find token authorizations in nova-consoleauth.

There is a typo in the logic around reconnect_intervl
which makes it skip setting the interval.

Let's fix that by making the code more explicit.
Tested with a custom reconnect interval set via:
ExtraConfig:
  pacemaker_remote_reconnect_interval: 120

And obtained the correct state of the remote resource:
[root@controller-0 ~]# pcs resource show compute-0 |grep reconnect
  Attributes: reconnect_interval=120 server=172.17.1.14

Before the fix there would be no reconnect_interval
attribute.

The current LBaaS is not reachable at port 443 and the k8s API server
is not reachable at port 6443 by the VIP of the LBaaS.

This commit fixes the issue by creating a security group rule to allow
tcp traffic to reach the LBaaS and adding a security group allowing
tcp traffic from the service subnet to the port used by the overcloud VM.

Previously we were only deploying a master node. This commit adds the
worker and infra service to the deployed node and configures it as an
all-in-one node. In order to do so, we need to disable HAproxy when
deploying in all-in-one as the HAproxy instance Openshift deploys on
the infra node conflicts with the one we normally set up. They both
bind ports 80 and 443.

Also removes the useless ComputeServices parameter that only makes
sense in a multinode environment.

Remove scripts and templates which dealt with Pacemaker and its
resource restarts before we moved to containerized deployments. These
should all now be unused.

Many environments had this mapping:

    OS::TripleO::Tasks::ControllerPreConfig: OS::Heat::None
    OS::TripleO::Tasks::ControllerPostConfig: OS::Heat::None
    OS::TripleO::Tasks::ControllerPostPuppetRestart: ../../extraconfig/tasks/post_puppet_pacemaker_restart.yaml

The ControllerPostPuppetRestart is only ever referenced from
ControllerPostConfig, so if ControllerPostConfig is OS::Heat::None, it
doesn't matter what ControllerPostPuppetRestart is mapped to.

This adds a scaled back replication implementation
that leaves the bulk of the work up to the driver.
We just provide basic admin API methods to do things
like enable/disable and fail-over.  Set up and
specification of replication targets for a specific
back end are now intended to be part of the cinder.conf
in the driver section itself.

Replication targets are configured via the cinder.conf
file in their associated driver section.  See the devref
doc included in this commit for details on the format.

The next step in configuration is to create a volume-type
with replication info in the extra-specs.
    extra-specs = replication=enable, volume_backend_name=foo

This instructs the driver to utilize replication, default is
up to the driver but would suggest single way rep and in the case
of multiple targets, driver could choose or have a default.

If the back end doesn't report replication=enabled in it's stats
updates the scheduler will fail to place the volume due to invalid
host, or no hosts available.

Vendors can easily modify extra-specs or their own config settings
to modify this behavior, any vendor-unique adaptation can be
provided through the use of scoped keys.  Suggested examples
will be published in docs.

This reimplements commit 67a7dc70f2885b7db2a42bc28c25ece0bbeba3e4.
Copytruncate becomes a default for containerized logrotate. The
solution based on signals processing goes away.

As long as key deployment framework components heat-engine and
mistral-engine do not tolerate SIGHUP copytruncate should be used.

There is more openstack services, like neutron-server, nova-scheduler
that cannot handle SIGHUP nicely yet.

Nor can we fall back to that predates the containerization of services
because of the following reasons:

* We cannot and should not use the restart command in postrotate as it
  was before containerization of services. For that a container needs
  to be privileged and granted a docker socket bind-mount, which is a
  total security antipattern and defeats the very purpose of
  containerization. Things may change with future adoption of Podman
  and/or kubelet control plane though. If/when that happens, we might
  consider an option for postrotate to terminate a process with
  SIGTERM, to have the process instantly respawned via its systemd
  unit/kubelet restart policies.

* Individual services' logrotate configs worth nothing, when still
  being handled by a central logrotation container running crond. And
  it needs to remain centralized as individual containers neither do
  run crond nor contain logrotate, nor lightweight containers following
  12-factors apps recommendations should do anything like that. Nor the
  host logrotate/crond can do rotation of logs for containers as we do/
  should not install required packages on the host, but only in
  containers. See also the spec [0] explaining the reasoning better.

All of that makes copytruncate a global choice for logs rotation of
containerized services as we just cannont be sure, if a service foo
*really* does correct processing of SIGHUP. We leave that option for
future implementation in the hope things get fixed eventually. As well
as the aforementioned systemd/kublet option, or the option to provide
stdout only logging [0] and let the logrotate thing go.

To match the previous functionality when not using config-download, the

when using --skip-deploy-identifier.

This patch adds a task to check if one of the json configuration files

We want to default to running all tox environments under python 3, so
set the basepython value in each environment.

We do not want to specify a minor version number, because we do not
want to have to update the file every time we upgrade python.

We do not want to set the override once in testenv, because that
breaks the more specific versions used in default environments like
py35 and py36.

- https://review.openstack.org/#/c/573851/
- https://review.openstack.org/#/c/573875/ (they pass here)

Porting this commit from master branch to feature/graphql.

In commit [1] openvswitch firewall driver is switched to be
default one used in devstack.
So various tempest jobs will use this driver and it will be
tested.
We now need separate job to test non-default firewall driver
which currently is iptables-hybrid driver.

the parsed yaml file already has the 'resource_registry' key in the
dictionary.

That was true with environments/enable-tls.yaml but is not
true any longer for environments/ssl/enable-tls.yaml.

Since Iaf7386207e5bd8b336759f51e4405fe15114123a in rocky
NodeTLSData is not used anymore, so let's just skip the whole assignment
starting with rocky.
