Fixes ``redfish`` RAID interface workflow to not create more than 1
logical disks per controller at the same time when controller does not
support 'Immediate' application time and system needs rebooting.

With this fix virtual disks are grouped by controller and executed
in batches when reboot is required.

This enables ``redfish`` RAID interface to be used with iDRAC systems
directly as although there are many controllers that support 'Immediate'
application time, they do it only when system has completed loading.
System intermittently completes loading after IPA starts executing
clean or deploy steps rendering controllers not supporting 'Immediate'
apply time and requiring reboot. This fix handles such scenario
instead of failing to create more than 1 virtual disk.

This commit fixes incorrect code in commit
c3805b2bea404cf6b831a3262e2602db72324616

There are 2 problems:
1) typo in FAT filesystem label
2) failure of running mcopy

1) typo in FAT filesystem label

   Above mentioned commit misspells VFAT label as ``ir-vfd-de``
   but it should have been ``ir-vfd-dev``

2) failure of running mcopy

   Till this commit, create_vfat_image function fails because it
   executes ``mcopy -s <tmp_dir>/*`` but it doesn't expand
   ``<tmp_dir>/*`` to list of file paths under ``<tmp_dir>``.

   This commit modifies create_vfat_image function to explicitly
   pass all file paths to mcopy.

There is a race condition between an incoming resize and an
update_available_resource periodic in the resource tracker. The race
window starts when the resize_instance RPC finishes  and ends when the
finish_resize compute RPC finally applies the migration context on the
instance.

In the race window, if the update_available_resource periodic is run on
the destination node, then it will see the instance as being tracked on
this host as the instance.node is already pointing to the dest. But the
instance.numa_topology still points to the source host topology as the
migration context is not applied yet. This leads to CPU pinning error if
the source topology does not fit to the dest topology. Also it stops the
periodic task and leaves the tracker in an inconsistent state. The
inconsistent state only cleanup up after the periodic is run outside of
the race window.

This patch applies the migration context temporarily to the specific
instances during the periodic to keep resource accounting correct.

With Kuryr, when a service of LoadBalancer type is created the
process is the next:
- Create a load balancer
- Associate FIP to the load balancer VIP

In busy enviroments, with HA, there may be a race condition where
the method to associate the FIP to the loadbalancer fails to find
the recently created loadbalancer, therefore not doing the FIP to
VIP association in the OVN NB DB.

Note: This was fixed in more recent branches by commit:
https://opendev.org/openstack/ovn-octavia-provider/commit/c6cee9207349a12e499cbc81fe0e5d4d5bfa015c

mechanism should not have been part of it. Thus making the backport

from ceph_namespace, ceph_tag, ceph_image defined in
container_image_prepare_defaults.yaml. If --image is
not passed then the default container defined in the
cephadm command is used instead. This patch adds the
--cephadm-default-container option to the 'openstack
overcloud ceph deploy' command so that --image is not
passed and whatever container is inside of cephadm is
used instead.

This patch fixes a problem that causes a stack update to fail as a

This commit changes the os-reset_status volume-api
to handle the below use cases
1.Can not reset volume to ""ing"" states

2.available volume reset to in-use - 400

The _reset_status method is override in VolumeAdminController class
to handle different volume states.

NOTE: with this change, some requests that previously succeeded will
return a 400.  However, these were requests that would leave a resource
in an inconsistent state with an inaccurate status, so a 400 is
appropriate.  We use a 400 (not 409) to be consistent with the current
Block Storage API. This change is not microversioned because it doesn't
make sense to only prevent operators from shooting themselves in the
foot if they happen to specify an appropriate microversion,
and be grievously wounded otherwise.

The core OVN code for Loadbalancers does not support a
manual failover from one gateway node to another. But
running the command with the OVN provider driver seems
to succeed:

$ openstack loadbalancer failover $ID
(no output)

The code actually does nothing and just returns the

Since it's unsupported by the underlying technology,
have the provider driver return an UnsupportedOptionError().

This reverts commit caae7b6a6f5e8944dbe359b6472be2507bbf5e12.

Reason for revert:
Many users still need L3 firewalls and Inspur team wants to maintain
this project.
Neutron drivers team discussed the topic of the maintenance of
neutron-fwaas, and agreed to include neutron-fwaas again to Neutron
stadium[1].

Some updates have been made:
Remove use ""autonested_transaction"" method, see more [2]
Replace ""neutron_lib.callbacks.registry.notify"" with ""registry.publish""
Replace rootwrap execution with privsep context execution.
Ensure db Models and migration scripts are sync, set table
firewall_group_port_associations_v2's two columns nullable=False

This change is proposed again, avoiding lsblk features missing from
older distros:
- lsblk is avoided entirely for a whole-disk image with a single
  partition, which would be the majority of old image building jobs
- Field PARTTYPENAME not available on the lsblk in CentOS-8, instead
  rely on the GUID being correct for EFI partitions
- Argument --output-all not available on the lsblk in CentOS-7, this
  is just for logging debug, so can be removed

Whitebox is able to completely fill its compute hosts because it runs
with things like PCI devices and dedicated CPUs. Because of that we
cannot wait for the class cleanup to run after the test *class* (which
is what Tempest does by default), we need to run cleanup after every
test *method* to make sure subsequent tests have enough resources.

This patch a create_test_server() wrapper that adds cleanup to the
test case cleanup with addCleanup(), overriding what the original
create_test_server() does with addClassResourceCleanup().

This means we can also remove some manual delete_server() calls that
were sprinkled here and there.

This patch adds definition of the functional and fullstack jobs
with enabled support for FIPS [1].
Jobs are based on the Centos 8 stream as this disto allows to enable
FIPS support.
Jobs are added to the experimental queue for now.

This patch also makes some changes in the bindep and

Previously, if all instances in the input file were pre-provisioned

unprovision network ports for pre-provisioned nodes.

This patch adds confirmation that network ports for pre-provisioned

then executed so that network ports for pre-provisioned nodes are

When LB or member is created, driver looks for the Logical Router which

This makes use of the keystone APIs to get limits from Keystone when
showing the user the limits on their project.

Note we also change the default in_use amount from -1, which is what the
no op driver originally used, to 0, which matches what the db driver
typically returns for deprecated quota values, like floating ip limits.
This seems a more sane value to respond with, given we don't count the
usage for those values.

A follow on patch will use this code to enforce the limits, this patch
provides integration with oslo.limit and a new internal nova API that is
able to enforce those limits.

The first part is providing a callback for oslo.limit to be able to count
the resources being used. We only count resources grouped by project_id.

For counting servers, we make use of the instance mappings list in the
api database, just as the existing quota code does. While we do check to
ensure the queued for delete migration has been completed, we simply
error out if that is not the case, rather than attempting to fallback to
any other counting system. We hope one day we can count this in
placement using consumer records, or similar.

For counting all other resource usage, they must refer to some usage
relating to a resource class being consumed in placement. This is similar
to how the count with placement variant of the existing placement code
works today. This is not restricted to RAM and VCPU, it is open to any
resource class that is known to placement.

The second part is the enforcement method, that keeps a similar
signature to the existing enforce_num_instnaces call that is use to
check quotas using the legacy quota system.

From the flavor we extract the current resource usage. This is
considered the simplest first step that helps us deliver Ironic limits
alongside all the existing RAM and VCPU limits. At a later date, we
would ideally get passed a more complete view of what resources are
being requested from placement.

NOTE: given the instance object doesn't exist when enforce is called, we
can't just pass the instance into here.

A [workarounds] option is also available for operators who need the
legacy quota usage behavior where VCPU = VCPU + PCPU.

This patch fixes multiple issues related to request ids:

- Duplicated request ID in logs
- Missing request id header in response
- Wrong request ID in response header when using noauth

The source of these issues is the fact that the request ID and the
request context are set too late, or not at all, in the paste filter
chain.

And the last bug is fixed as a freebie when the code in auth.py is
refactored to reduce code duplication on setting the cinder.context key
in the request's environment.

The patch fixes these issue by changing the filter chains to have the
request_id filter as the first filter, and using our own filter for it,
to ensure that the context is correctly set.

Not sure if values now defined in ENV_OVERWRITES are still necessary,
so the patch preserves current behavior.

driver, that is basically a no-op. This is to make it easier to remove
the legacy code paths in the future.

Note, over quota exceptions raised with unified limits use the standard
(improved) exception message as those raised by oslo.limit. They
however do use the existing exception code to ease integration. The
user of the API will see the same return codes, no matter which code is
enabled to enforce the limits.

Finally, this also adds test coverage where it was missing. Coverage
for ""quota recheck"" behavior in KeypairAPI is added where all other
KeypairAPI testing is located. Duplicate coverage is removed from
nova/api/openstack/compute/test_keypairs.py at the same time.

Currently, the object-expirer is a little delete-happy -- after a
container gets processed, an attempt is always made to delete it,
even if we know it will fail with a 409 because either

    * we found items that this worker won't process (see the
      process/processes config options) or

    * we encountered failures processing items and thus didn't
      pop all the records off the queue that we *could* process.

The failed DELETE has downsides such as

    * adding unnecessary load to the container servers (though
      the 409 can hopefully be serviced fairly quickly) and

    * evicting container info and listing shard ranges from
      memcache, which

    * can further load the container-servers (if the expiry queues
      have gotten large enough to shard), as all the expirers
      doing listings now have to go fetch shard ranges directly
      from the DB.

Now, only attempt to delete an expiry container if it appears to be
empty. In any reasonably-sized cluster, we expect dozens to hundreds of
concurrent expirers to be processing the expiry queues. Seeing the
container empty is the most reliable signal that the delete is expected
to succeed.

As per the RBAC new direction, we will allow
project resources operation to be performed by
the project scoped token only and system user will
be allowed to perform system level operation only
not project resources specific.

Details about new direction can be found in community-wide
goal

This commit modify remaining APIs as per the new guidelines.

Also, allow all project admin to list the other project limits. This is
what we allowed in legacy policy and until we have domain admin or other
way to list other project resources/info, we will keep that behaviour.

Also modifying and adding tests for four cases:
1. enforce_scope=False + legacy rule (current default policies)
2. enforce_scope=False + No legacy rule
3. enforce_scope=True + legacy rule
4. enforce_scope=True + no legacy rule (end goal of new RBAC)

As per the RBAC new direction, we will allow
project resources operation to be performed by
the project scoped token only and system user will
be allowed to perform system level operation only
not project resources specific.

Local API and DB limits are limits on resources that are counted either
as an API request parameter (example: server metadata items) or as
records in the database (example: server key pairs).

Future patches will make use of this logic, and actually enforce the
limits. This patch just adds the infrastructure to allow for the
enforcement of the limits.

We are moving all existing quotas to be managed via Keystone's
unified limits.

To stop confusion between injected_file_path_length and
injected_file_path_bytes, the unified limit in Keystone will use the
latter name to match the name used the API.

These local limits are all about preventing excessive load on the API
and database and have little to do with resource usage. These limits
are represented by keystone registered limits only, accordingly.

Local limits include things that just limit items in an API request:
* metadata_items
* injected_files
* injected_file_content_bytes
* injected_file_path_bytes

Local limits also include things that are stored in the database:
* key_pairs
* server_groups
* server_group_members

Some resource names have been changed to prepend a prefix of ""server_""
in order to disambiguate them from other potential unified limits in
keystone:

* metadata_items => server_metadata_items
* injected_files => server_injected_files
* injected_file_content_bytes => server_injected_file_content_bytes
* injected_file_path_bytes => server_injected_file_path_bytes
* key_pairs => server_key_pairs

Note that each of the above are counted via a different scope. This new
code ensures that key_pairs are counted per user, server_groups are
counted per project and server_group_members are counted per
server_group.

Note: Previously server_group_member were counted per user inside each
server_group, which has proved very confusing, as adding more users into
a project increases the maximum size of allowed for a server_group.

containers does not consume all the time of the object-updater.

The directories are all processed in parallels, one async-pending
per directory at a time, up to the concurrency limit. The goal is to avoid
spawning all the concurrency on a single container that is already in
trouble and have a many async-pendings on disk.

Failures and time limit are not enforced on legacy suffix directories.

Currently playbook slurps constraints.txt valid for a first host in a
batch and then uses it for each other host.

It saves time but batch may consists of hosts with different operating
systems or even OSA versions and current mechanism doesn't take this
into account.

In my opinion we should slurp constraints.txt separately for each host.

Given the way the quota system currently works, the reserved value can

It saves time but batch may consists of hosts with different operating

This patch adds the plumbing for rebuilding a volume backed
instance. This functionality will be enabled in a subsequent patch
which adds a new microversion and the external support for requesting
it.
The flow of the operation is as follows:

1) Detach the volume
2) Create an empty attachment
3) Request cinder to reimage the volume
4) Wait for cinder to notify success to nova (via external events)
5) Update and complete the attachment

Currently playbook slurps constraints.txt valid for a first host in a
batch and then uses it for each other host.

It saves time but batch may consists of hosts with different operating
systems or even OSA versions and current mechanism doesn't take this
into account.

In my opinion we should slurp constraints.txt separately for each host.
