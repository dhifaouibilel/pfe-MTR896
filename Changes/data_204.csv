This follows other clustered services (like RabbitMQ) and

Tempest is intermittently failing a test which does the
following:

1. Create a server.
2. Shelve offload it.
3. Unshelve it.

Tempest waits for the server status to be SHELVED_OFFLOADED
before unshelving the server, which goes through the
scheduler to pick a compute node and claim resources on it.

When shelve offloading a server, the resource allocations
for the instance and compute node it was on are cleared, which
will also delete the internal consumer record in the placement
service.

The race is that the allocations are removed during shelve
offload *after* the server status changes to SHELVED_OFFLOADED.
This leaves a window where unshelve is going through the
scheduler and gets the existing allocations for the instance,
which are non-empty and have a consumer generation. The
claim_resources method in the scheduler then uses that
consumer generation when PUTing the allocations. That PUT
fails because in between the GET and PUT of the allocations,
placement has deleted the internal consumer record. When
PUTing the new allocations with a non-null consumer generation,
placement returns a 409 conflict error because for a new
consumer it expects the ""consumer_generation"" parameter to be
None.

This change handles the race by simply making sure the allocations
are deleted (along with the related consumer record in placement)
*before* the instance.vm_status is changed.

This patch fixes the constant chrony container crash loop after (Debian 10) server is rebooted,
as described in Bug-ID: #1915528.

Due to permissions issue, before this fix is applied chronyd process will be exiting with
root cause error message:

This has to do with priviledges we configured for chrony. Relaxing them fixes the issue.

Warnings are now turned into errors, failing
the doc build. This should prevent any more
syntax issues resulting in malformed, but still syntactically
valid, html output.

To aid with diagnosis of the failures:

The -E flag is now set to rebuild environment
from scratch for each run.

The `-a` flag is set to rebuild all html files,
regardless of their date.

The `--keep-going` flag is set so that the build
doesn't end after encountering first error, but
continues until the bitter end.

Because of the libvirt issue[1], there is a bug[2] that if we set cache mode
whose write semantic is not O_DIRECT (.i.e unsafe, writeback or writethrough),
there will be a problem with the volume drivers
(.i.e nova.virt.libvirt.volume.LibvirtISCSIVolumeDriver,
nova.virt.libvirt.volume.LibvirtNFSVolumeDriver and so on), which designate
native io explicitly.

That problem will generate a libvirt xml for the instance,
whose content contains

```
...
<disk ... >
  <driver ... cache='unsafe/writeback/writethrough' io='native' />
</disk>
...
```
In turn, it will fail to start the instance or attach the disk.

Following this change it is possible to add 'Depends-On' lines to a
kolla commit message that point to reviews in other projects. For
example, this could be used to test building and deploying container
images containing a change to the nova project that is currently in
review.

It also allows to introduce jobs testing against Kolla in other
projects.

The kolla-build-config Ansible role can also be used by other projects,
such as kolla-ansible, to generate the necessary configuration.

This takes us closer to the Kolla Builder - Next Generation concept [1].

If a volume driver takes an excessively long amount

if this is a generic ""Function outlasted interval"" message

Introduce a specific log message when this happens so
that this situation is more clear for someone looking

The message is set to trigger if the driver takes more
than half of the stats polling interval to complete.

The Secure RBAC effort has updated Ironic such that it
can support a mode where it is scope enforcing for all
interactions with the API. Due to the design, and operating
nature of Ironic's API, services speaking with it must
authenticate with a system scope to have a full picture
of the universe.

In this case, we need to update the nova configuration
accordingly such that the compute service understands
how to talk to ironic so that it can see the nodes under
management.

Ironic will likely update this again at a later point in
time to enable a ""hybrid"" mixed-mode as the operating model
and related permissions *should* allow nova to use a project
scoped ""owner"" account with Ironic, in order to access
and command nodes to deploy. But at this time, we're
focusing on the exclusive operating mode.

Error-out the migrations (cold and live) whenever the
anti-affinity policy is violated. This addresses
violations when multiple concurrent migrations are
requested.

Added detection on:
- prep_resize
- check_can_live_migration_destination
- pre_live_migration

The improved method of detection now locks based on group_id
and considers other migrations in-progress as well.

Recent changes are causing this failure when starting

The issue is that the networking-ovn code imported by the

causing the problem.

Since there are a couple of backports implicated, and

InternalTLSNbdCAFile, InternalTLSVncCAFile and InternalTLSQemuCAFile
do not point to the default IPA ca.crt file and instead are requested
to be loaded to component specific CA files (even if they are the same).
This can lead to a race where the CA cert is not being written by
certmonger in time and the following issue is seen after the 60s timeout:

May  1 16:47:39 puppet-user: Notice: /Stage[main]/Tripleo::Profile::Base::Certmonger_user/Tripleo::Certmonger::Libvirt_vnc[libvirt-vnc-server-cert]/Certmonger_certificate[libvirt-vnc-server-cert]/ensure: created

May  1 16:48:40 puppet-user: Error: /Stage[main]/Tripleo::Profile::Base::Certmonger_user/Tripleo::Certmonger::Libvirt_vnc[libvirt-vnc-server-cert]/Exec[/etc/pki/CA/certs/vnc.crt]/returns: change from 'notrun' to ['0'] failed: 'test -f /etc/pki/CA/certs/vnc.crt' returned 1 instead of one of [0]

The problem here is that certmonger doesn't behave in the way that we
expect it to do. When we make the cert request and ask for the ca cert to
be retrieved, it issues the cert and schedules the cert to be returned
asynchronously, even if you specify -w to wait for the cert.  -w will block
pending the cert being retrieved, but not for the CA cert.

You can always force the retrieval to happen by restarting certmonger, and
this has helped in some cases in the past, but is a less than ideal
solution.

This is a bug in certmonger IMHO, in that we should expect the CA cert to
be returned synchronously along with the cert if we specify -w.

The BZ for certmonger is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon though, so we
need to look at other options.

Ib868465c20d97c62cbcb214bfc62d949bd6efc62 already changed the default to
use the IPA system cacert file '/etc/ipa/ca.crt' per default starting with
the wallaby release using the ansible role. This change backports to also
use the IPA system cacert file '/etc/ipa/ca.crt' to previous release when
managing the certs via puppet-tripleo.

  I1f02487e0ae9da4f7a455a1142f94f0ecdd8450c

Fix issues in tripleo_ovn_mac_addresses module

- Don't initialize thread pool when no servers
  (can't do with 0 workers)
- Fix bridge_mappings default
- Don't call write_vars_file when no servers or static_mappings

Also use correct argument for stack_name in
cli-overcloud-delete.yaml playbook.

With this change we explicitely tell the stonith-fence_compute-fence-nova

This is a good idea in general as it makes things more explicit and
we do not rely on other pcmk mechanisms (stonith querying the list

is allowed to fence.

As called out in the original spec [1] virtio devices attached to a SEV
enabled instance must have the iommu attribute enabled. This was done
within the original implementation of the spec for all virtio devices
defined when initially spawning the instance but does not include volume

slightly refactors the original designer code to make it usable in both

Error-out the migrations (cold and live) whenever the
anti-affinity policy is violated. This addresses
violations when multiple concurrent migrations are
requested.

Added detection on:
- prep_resize
- check_can_live_migration_destination
- pre_live_migration

The improved method of detection now locks based on group_id

The current code looks at a hash ring node's created_at/updated_at
fields and tries to determine whether the node has been updated
based on whether updated_at - created_at > 1 second (due to the
method that initially fills them being different by microseconds).
Unfortunately, due to the notify() method being called which calls
the hash ring node's touch_node(), a node can be updated in under
a second, meaning we will prevent caching for much longer than
we intend.

When using sqlite in-memory db, this continually re-creating the
Hash Ring objects for every event that is processed is exposing an
issue where rows that should be in the db just *aren't*.

This patch instead limits the hash ring nodes to api workers and
prevents caching only until the number of nodes == number of api
workers on the host. The switch from spawning hash ring nodes
where !is_maintenance to is_api_worker is primarily because it
seems to be difficult to get a list of *all* workers from which to
subtract the maintenance worker so that _wait_startup_before_caching
can wait for that specific number of workers. In practice, this
means that RpcWorker and ServiceWorker workers would not process
HashRing events.

A note on bug 1903008: While this change will greatly reduce the
likelihood of this issue taking place, we still have some work to
do in order to fully understand why it rubs the database backend
in the wrong way. Thus, we will make this change 'related to'
instead of closing the bug.

Currently neutron uses socket.gethostname() to determine hypervisor
names, but this implementation is not fully compatible with libvirt
driver which uses canonical name for hypervisor name.
This incompatibility causes an issue with root resource provider
detection if a deployment uses FQDNs as canonicanl names.

This change introduces the resource_provider_default_hypervisor option,
so that users can override the hypervisor name by the single option(*1)
instead of setting two list options(*2). This is especially useful if
the deployment has multiple bridges or interfaces.

When enacting the upgrade from RHEL7 to RHEL8 using leapp,
the default behaviour for leapp is to upgrade to the latest
RHEL version it supports. This is currently 8.4, but will
end up being RHEL 8.6 in the future.

This change makes UpgradeLeappDevelSkip a per-role parameter.

With this change we explicitely tell the stonith-fence_compute-fence-nova
resource which pacemaker nodes it is allowed to fence.

This is a good idea in general as it makes things more explicit and
we do not rely on other pcmk mechanisms (stonith querying the list
of nodes returned by the fence agent) to determine which nodes it
is allowed to fence.

Tested with this change and the stonith resource is correctly set:

Traditionally,  Ganesha consumes /etc/idmapd.conf, which controls
mapping of user/owner identities under NFSv4+.  With containerized service
deployment, this file has beenan immutable part of the container image
and could not be modified.

Recently ceph-ansible was modified to allow the user to set the path
for idmapd.conf and to override ini settings in this file by supplying
json configuration for the overrides in the same way that it can be
supplied for ceph.conf overrides [1].  Also, the default path setting
for the idmapd.conf file is /etc/ganesha/idmap.conf, which already is
reflected into containerized ganesha under /etc/ganesha, solving the
immutability issue.  If no overrides are supplied, the file put in this
location will match that originally frozen into the container, so there
is no issue here with backwards compatibility.

This change exposes parameters for idmap.conf file path and override
contents in TripleO and passes them into ceph-ansible.  It also sets up
these parameters for cephadm.  Cephadm support for OpenStack Ganesha
is WIP so there will likely need to be a followup patch to make these

The new ""migrate"" mode for the DB sync utility changes DB contents as
follows:

 - it changes vxlan networks to Geneve, including its allocation in
   order to avoid future collisions when creating new geneve networks
 - it removes settings from ports' vif_details that are no longer
   needed, such as hybrid plugging or bridge_name for the trunk bridges
 - it sets profile for subports - OVN doesn't use trunk_details but port
   profile to store data about trunk. Subports have tag and parent_name
   fileds.

Previously, the vxlan to Geneve change was done via ansible role. The
tasks in the role were replaced by the script therefore the role is
removed.

is gone and doesn't reconnect. Ultimately, this is something that
needs to be fixed in python-ovs, but setting the SO_KEEPALIVE socket
option avoids the issue. This also has the benefit that the client
doesn't need to send 'echo' requests, which can time out on an
overloaded ovsdb-server, which causes a disconnection which then
adds even more load on the ovsdb-server as it has to send the entire
db contents over the wire after the connection.
