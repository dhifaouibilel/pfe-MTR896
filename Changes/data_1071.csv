deprecated and renamed to [deploy] erase_devices_priority as part of the
commit 9a35ca19b4872af2e02cb83b21a3746732802e74.

This patch also fixes the FIXME comment because it's wrong, cleaning is
not disabled in gate, only the erase_devices step.

Also validate that the event handlers are called for the

These are not unit tests, but added in the unit test tree

The requirement was never on the Ironic side, it was only enforced here
in os-cloud-config. Previously, to get around the requirement, one could

This adds the CORS support middleware to Cue, allowing a deployer
to optionally configure rules under which a javascript client may
break the single-origin policy and access the API directly.

For cue, the middleware was added directly to the application
factory, including various default headers usually required by
keystone. Note that the CORS middleware must be the first one in
the middleware chain, so that it can annotate all responses -
even error responses - generated by other middleware.

oslo_config initialization was added to the functional test
initialization, in order to ensure that a fully initialized
config instance is available during tests.

vCenter 6.0 added support for a new type of datastore called VVOL
datastore. A VVOL datastore represents a storage container which
is a logical grouping of virtual volumes in an array that supports
VVOL. A virtual disk in a VVOL datastore corresponds to a virtual
volume in the array. Since VVOL datastores are treated like VMFS
or NFS datastores by vCenter APIs, the changes in the VMDK driver
to support VVOL datastores are minimal.

This patch adds the following changes in the VMDK driver to support
VVOL datastores:

* Add VVOL datastore type to the list of allowed datastore types

* Skip VVOL datastore while creating a volume from a preallocated
glance image because it involves replacing the data file of a
temporary virtual disk with the downloaded preallocated image
which VVOL cannot support.

In python 3 it's important to keep track of what variables are
text (six.text_type) vs binary (six.binary_type) when dealing
with inputs as strings calling functions that deal with bytes,
such as base64 functions and crypto functions. I added
documentation to track where things are text vs where they're
binary.

TokenFormatter.restore_padding takes text and returns text,
so it shouldn't be using binary '='.

token.provider.base64_encode should return text, not bytes.

token.provider.random_urlsafe_str should return text, not bytes.

A few other byte/string usages were fixed.

The python unicode doc suggests that code should work with
unicode (six.text_type) internally and only switch to bytes
(six.binary_type) at the edges, so this change is a move in that
direction. See https://docs.python.org/3.5/howto/unicode.html .

A symbolic link which is /etc/neutron/plugin.ini pointing to
/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini is told to create when
we install and configure the networking service in the
compute node.
But it's no need to be created, because there is no
'/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini' file and
the ML2 plug-in is installed in the controller node.
Thus we should remove this command and skip this step.

Add new hiera configuration key 'external_lb'. If it's set to
true then we should not configure Haproxy LB on controllers and
also we should switch 'haproxy_backend_status' to 'http' provider.

We calculate 'external_lb' during 'globals.pp' task - if we have
no VIPs with 'haproxy' namespace, then it's set to 'true'.

It does not change the default deployment scheme.

Also fixing minor issue with default provider for
'haproxy_backend_status' type.

This patch implements the Active/Standby blueprint in
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/octavia/+spec/activepassiveamphora

The following points describe the main changes:

1. The patch introduces new flows and subflows to create M amphorae. The
controller worker parses the loadbalancer_topology configuration. If the
loadbalancer_topology value is ACTIVE_STANDBY, the controller invokes a new flow
independent from the SINGLE topology case, which is left untouched. The new
flow uses conditional taskflows to check for spare amphorae at runtime. This
removes the need for the exception workaround we earlier had. The controller
creates the amphorae in parallel using an unordered flow. A new database task
alter an amphora role as either MASTER or BACKUP and assigns a VRRP priority to
each amphora. After the amphorae are created, the controller invokes a separate
flow for post amphora configuration including plug_vip methods, vrrp
configuration upload, and keepalived service start.

2. The patch introduces new data models that include a new table for VRRP group
configuration per loadbalancer, and update the amphora, loadbalancer, and
listener tables to support the new active/standby capability. The VRRPGroup
table hides authentication data, and makes future extensions of VRRP
capabilities easy.

3. This patch updates the existing Haproxy configuration templates  to include
peer synchronization. In case of ACTIVE_STANDBY configuration, the jinja
configuration renders the peer section in the Haproxy configuration and assigns
short names to the amphorae as listener peers. As listeners implies different
Haproxy process, each listener synchronizes on a different port evaluated as
BASE_PORT (1024) + NUMBER_OF_LISTENERS accounting for ports in use.

4. This patch introduces a new Jinja configuration templater and a REST driver
for Keepalived (developed as a Mixin). By default, Keepalived runs ""all"" check
scripts found in a predefined directory. The keepalived driver is a Mixin that
can be plugged in other services' drivers. It is the responsibility of these
services drivers to introduce their own check scripts. In this patch a
lightweight check script for Haproxy was introduced along with changes in the
amphora agent installation script.

5. The VRRP requires enabling protocol 112 for Master/Backup advertisements,
and enabling protocol 51 for authentication header. This patch enables these
protocols as needed in the loadbalancer security group.

Note: Updates to the failover flow to support active/standby will come in
a dependent patch.
Note: The amphora-agent is pinned to this patch in this patch set.  This
is required so the scenario tests will pass.  It will be removed in a
follow up patch.

ekko is a project that will bring block-based backup to OpenStack in a
way that is scallable by using object-storage for the backend. The
backup itself is enabled by a new feature in QEMU 2.4 that allows for
changed block tracking and incremental backups of running VMs.

A common feature I have seen requested throughout the community is
true block-based backups of VMs. I have been working on a way to solve
the scalability issue of backups for a while [1] and now that QEMU has
officially released this feature we can bring backup to OpenStack in a
way that is as scallable as OpenStack itself using Swift as a backend.

This would be different than a nova snapshot because that is not a
true backup. That does not allow for the space savings of incremental
backups nor compression or encryption which are requirements for a
good backup in my experience.

Future goals would including bringing this to other hypervisors since
Hyper-V and VMWare both support CBT and incremental backups of running
VMs. As well as potentially backing up Cinder volumes in a similiar
fashion.

- Spellcheck and make other changes
- Remove passive voice from api-site
- Renamed api-ref/src/wadls/identity-api/src/v1/api_samples
  to .../samples
- Renamed code samples using this naming convention:
  <resource>-<action>-request.json or <resource>-<action>-response.json.
  For example, volume-create-request.json and volume-create-response.json.
- Removed unused code samples
- Made method names consistent throughout
- use list<resource> for list operations,
  show<resource> for show operations, and so on.
- Remove XML code samples
- Change csapi:uuid -> csapi:UUID

Every instance of FakeExchange had topic queue and server queue as
